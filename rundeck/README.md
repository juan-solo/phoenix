rundeck
==============

This repository contains the source for the [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org/) [docker](https://docker.io) image.

# Image details

1. Based on debian:wheezy
1. Supervisor, Apache2, and rundeck
1. No SSH.  Use [nsenter](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter)
1. If RUNDECK_PASSWORD is not supplied, it will be randomly generated and shown via stdout.
1. Supply the SERVER_URL or else you won't get too far :)
1. As always, update passwords for pre-installed accounts
1. I sometimes get connection reset by peer errors when building the Docker image from the Rundeck download URL.  Trying again usually works.
